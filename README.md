# Game Tactic Forum
Welcome to Game Tactic Forum.

- There are three game sections on the forum: Counter-Strike, League of Legends, and PlayerUnknown'S BattleGrounds. As we designed the project, we wanted to make a system where the posts would be sorted. The best way that we came up with is that the users would see the highest quality posts on the top and the posts of lower quality on the bottom. Hence, we provide the upvote system on the forum so that in every game session, users are able to type their game tactic ideas, then post to the server. The position of the post depends on net like-dislike similar to Reddit. Our server records the amount of likes and dislikes and calculates the net total for every post and sorts them by ascending order. The highest net like-dislike post on every game section will be also for the user to view on the homepage.
