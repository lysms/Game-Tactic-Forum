        <p>Counter-Strike is one of the most widely played video games of all time. A large portion of its success comes from its pick up and play control scheme where you use a few mouse and keyboard buttons to run and shoot. The game features an innovative currency system that grants you access to a wide variety of weapons over the course of a match. Find your favorite weapons, then join a server to get shooting.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The teams are largely the same and the game lets you change teams throughout the match. The team you pick determines your objectives on the map. For example, on a bomb defusal map, the terrorists have to plant and explode a bomb. The counter-terrorists win by defusing the bomb.</li>
            <li>Most people get tripped up a little with movement. The “W,” “A,” “S,” and “D” keys control your movement by default. "W" and "D" let you move forward and backward. “A” and “D” allow you to strafe, or move from side to side.</li>
            <li>Running everywhere is a sure way to alert enemies to your presence. Hit the “Shift” key to slow your character down, then hit it again to return to running. Press “CTRL” to duck and the spacebar to jump.</li>
            <li>You are only allowed to carry 2 weapons at a time in Counter-Strike. The left mouse button fires whatever weapon you are holding. The right mouse button activates the weapon’s secondary function, such as zooming in with a sniper scope. - Press “Q” to switch between your primary and secondary weapon. The “R” button allows you to reload your weapon.</li>
            <li>Press “B” to bring up the gun menu when you begin playing. Counter-Strike’s unique feature is its weapon economy. When you enter a game, you get $800. That money allows you to buy guns, grenades, and armor from the menu. The menu gives you a lot of toys to play with, so it may feel a little intimidating at first, but don’t feel pressured to buy anything.</li>
            <li>Press “K” or “U” to communicate with your team throughout the match.</li>
            <li>Shoot in small bursts at the target’s head and chest to succeed. </li>
            <li>Stay calm and have fun while playing the game.</li>
        </ul>
