    <h1>League of Legends</h1>
    <p>League of Legends is a team-based strategy game where two teams of five powerful champions face off to destroy the otherâ€™s base. Choose from over 140 champions to make epic plays, secure kills, and take down towers as you battle your way to victory.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Destroy The Base - Nexus is where minions spawn. Behind the Nexus is the Fountain, where you can quickly replenish health and mana and access the Shop. By Destroying the enemy Nexus wins the game.</li>
        <li>Clear The Path - Team needs to clear at least one lane to get to the enemy Nexus. Blocking your path are defense structures called turrets and inhibitors. Each lane has three turrets and one inhibitor, and each Nexus is guarded by two turrets.</li>
        <li>Take on The Jungle - In between the lanes is the jungle, where neutral monsters and jungle plants reside. The two most important monsters are Baron Nashor and the Drakes. Killing these units grants unique buffs for your team and can also turn the tide of the game.</li>
        <li>Choose Your Lane - There are five positions that make up the recommended team comp for the game.</li>
