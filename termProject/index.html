                <li class="home">For the term project, our team decided to create a video game tactics forum. The purpose is simple: the forums would allow users to share their tactics and ideas about a select amount of video games. A user on the forum would be able to
                    use the tactics creator on the website to share their ideas to the rest of the forum. These tactics would be helpful to everyone, especially to the players who just started playing the game recently. Some of the tactics would include
                    what is the most optimal movement through a section of a map or different kinds of loadouts for a specific character and how to use it effectively.</li>
                <li class="home">The section located at the right side is showing all the top voted post in each video game that we provided. You can click on the icon to the corresponding video game pages.</li>
                <li class="home">This project is design by Group 9 in Introduction to Information Technology & Web Science class, our members are Charles Villagran, Philip Chang and Yanshen Lin. The main idea that focus us to make this video game forum is we want every
                    video games player can share their idea to other players.</li>
